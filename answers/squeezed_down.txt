Prompt
~~~~~~

An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?

As the algorithm designer, we are responsible to estimate the issue talked about above that happens somehow.
The key idea is to reach out to the clients before they reach out to us. The server should generate a warning
when the sum of the requested value exceeds the allocation amount. In this scenario, we should acknowledge to
the investors that we have a potential oversubscribed issue, and they may be allocated a lower amount than their requests.

The communication after clients reach out to us is not effective. Like I said in the previous question, the goal is to
maintain the fiduciary and trust. We will state that we acknowledge the frustration from the clients, and explain the
real reason that they are allocated lower than their request.

I believe the current proration basis is able to guarantee the fairness to everyone. I would suggest to consider the requeted
amount and the average amount together. For example, adding ratios before the requested amount and average amount the calculate
the final weight. Also, we can setup a threshold to minimize the small investment amount, and expend the allocatoin space
for the large investors.
